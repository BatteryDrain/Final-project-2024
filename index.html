            Learning to code can be verry daunting, the syntax is very specific, the logic verry confusing and the worst part is you don't even know where to start. Look no more I am here to help! I think coding is a skill not an inherant abilty. When learning any skill you should approach it from a pont that is engging, fun and simple. I am offing lessons to introduce anyone, regardless of age to coding and design. We won't be reading documents nor textbooks instead we will make it fun by engaging you to make games! If this sounds scary to you, please don't be discorraged, I have divided the entire process into 4 easy segmants, where we will look at each one and explore them together. Instead of starting at logic and reasoning we will first build our games with simple inputs like pressing the "H" key. This way we get a feel for Scrastch withut being forced into logic, which can sem daunting, but I hope to show you how easy it is.

        <p class="title">Interview.</p>
        <p>Here you will get to meet with me and we can explore what you want to learn or want help with. </p>
        <p class="title">Standard first Lesson</p>
        <p>We will start here with inputs.</p>
        <p>Then we will look at connecting thos inputs to simple objects like squares and circles!</p>
        <p>After we will introduce costumes.</p>
        <p>Next we will intoduce a small bit of logic with "if" blocks.</p>
        <p>Then we will look at assembeling conditions.</p>
        <p>Here I will give you some condition chalenges.</p>
        <p class="title">Standard second Lesson</p>
        <p>First we will look at the chalenges you compleated, taking the time to answer any questions you have.</p>
        <p>Next we will introduce varibles.</p>
        <p>After this we will show how to change varibles.</p>
        <p>Then we will expand on conditions with making a sprite write a sentance for us.</p>
        <p>Next I will chalenge you to make something using varibles.</p>
        <p>After we will do an experiment looking at the diffrent types ov varibles.</p>
        <p>Finally we will connect this to inputs and make our first game together!</p>
        <p class="title">Third Standard Lesson</p>
        <p>Here we will introduce clones and take a look at how they work.</p>
        <p>Then we will explore ways to controll clones.</p>
        <p>Next we will make a game with clones.</p>
        <p>Next we will look at how to arrange these clones.</p>
        <p> Finally we will build tic tac toe.</p>
        <p class="title"> Forth Standard Lesson</p>
        <p>I will ask you to build a game, you can pick from a list of ideas if you need insparation.</p>
        <p>I will help you with any problems you have and we can review topics if you want.</p>
